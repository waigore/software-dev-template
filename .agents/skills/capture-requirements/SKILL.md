  Capture requirements via guided questions derived from each spec's authoring
  rules and template placeholders, confirm answers with the user, then hand off
  to author-spec. A long first prompt does not lock specs: offer a PoC and save
  downstream detail as notes. Downstream specs wait until a slice is being
  formalized and its blocking high-level fields are set.
  Use when interviewing for any spec, or when the user asks to capture
  requirements, gather requirements, or fill a spec by asking questions.

  Examples:
    - user: "Help me capture requirements" → offer a PoC; do not interview the tree
    - user: long prompt with pitch, platforms, and feature rules → save notes, offer a PoC, lock nothing
    - user: "Help me fill definition by asking questions" → specs/definition/definition.md only
    - user: "Formalize the auth PoC" → blocking fields if unset, then the keep-list specs
    - user: "Capture requirements for product and ux" → ask which one path this session, and only while formalizing
    - unclear approach during technical capture → propose PoC; log purpose/scope/outcome; offer task when agent-orc or a wave will own it

# Capture requirements

Interview, then write via [`author-spec`](../author-spec/SKILL.md) and open a spec PR. Do not run `review-spec` or audits unless the user asks separately.

## High-level stage

These files set the big parameters every other spec builds on:

1. `specs/vision.md`
2. `specs/definition/definition.md`
3. `specs/definition/quality.md` — targets, axis binding, and domain characteristics are [`author-quality-rubrics`](../author-quality-rubrics/SKILL.md). The performance blocking field is the `frame-time` and `hitch-bound` targets that skill records.

**Blocking fields** for a slice being formalized: elevator pitch, essential qualities, scope, user objectives, supported platforms, stack, spec depth, and a performance target. A field is unset when it is still `<!-- fill in -->` or a TBD. Other placeholders in the three files may stay. At `prototype`, other quality categories may stay N/A until a kept slice needs them ([`docs/poc-promotion.md`](../../../docs/poc-promotion.md)).

Do not capture these files before a slice is formalized, unless the user names one of them.

When a formalize run must set more than one unset blocking field, capture those fields together: one interview, one combined confirmation, one PR.

## Detailed input

When the user's input goes beyond the target (often a long first prompt), sort every statement before interviewing:

- **High-level**: a statement that answers, or implies an answer to, a vision, definition, or quality field. Product detail counts when it implies one, such as "trial ends after 14 days" for scope. Use it as a **proposed answer** in the interview, citing the statement; never write it unconfirmed.
- **Downstream**: product, UX, QA, ADR, or technical detail. Save it as a [requirement note](../../../docs/requirements/README.md) for its target. Author it only when that slice is being formalized.
- **Conflict**: a detail that contradicts or goes beyond the high-level answers (scope, non-goals, platforms, constraints, qualities). Raise it in the interview and ask how to resolve it: change the high-level answer, change or drop the detail, or mark it TBD. Save only the resolved version as a note.

## Steps

0. **Setup**: [`docs/skills.md`](../../../docs/skills.md) `ensure-project-setup` hook.
1. **Resolve and confirm the target**:
   - **Not formalizing** (no keep list, and the user did not name a spec file): do not interview the tree. Sort the input per **Detailed input**, save notes, and offer [`scope-poc`](../scope-poc/SKILL.md). Stop.
   - **Formalizing**: capture unset blocking fields together, then the specs in the keep list. If those fields are set but a blocking TBD remains, run [`audit-spec-tbd`](../audit-spec-tbd/SKILL.md) on them instead.
   - **A high-level file named**: capture that file. Do not expand into the rest of the tree. When the file is `specs/definition/quality.md`, run [`author-quality-rubrics`](../author-quality-rubrics/SKILL.md) for targets and axes, then stop this interview.
   - **Downstream named** while blocking fields are unset: do not capture it. Say which blocking fields are missing, keep its detail per **Detailed input**, and offer a PoC or the blocking fields.
   - **Downstream named** while formalizing and blocking fields are set: capture that slice.
   - **Ambiguous or several downstream named**: ask which **one** file this run.
2. **Load capture context**: resolve rules the same way [`author-spec`](../author-spec/SKILL.md) does (do not invent a parallel chain). Read each existing target and/or the folder `_template` placeholders, the [requirement notes](../../../docs/requirements/README.md) for each target, and minimal upstream only when those rules require grounding.
3. **Sort and interview**. Sort the input per **Detailed input**. Derive questions from required sections, placeholders, and gaps vs the rules; lead each with its proposed answer from the input or notes when one exists. Prefer few focused rounds over a dump. For already-filled sections, ask only to confirm or revise. Raise conflicts. When the user has not decided something, record it as TBD per [Undecided aspects](../../specs/rules/README.md#undecided-aspects-tbd); do not invent product decisions. In the high-level stage, point out when a TBD would be blocking.
4. **PoC requests**. When the slice is not formalized, or a claim rests on unproven achievability, **propose** a PoC, or **accept** one the user requests. Draft purpose, scope, and desired outcome. Same path for both. See [`docs/pocs.md`](../../../docs/pocs.md) and [`docs/requirements/poc-requests.md`](../../../docs/requirements/poc-requests.md). Do not treat a PoC as a gate for already-formalized main-tree work.
5. **Confirm**. Short bullet summary per target of what will be written, each TBD with its open question, the notes to save, PoC requests to log (purpose/scope/outcome/trigger), and the notes consumed or rejected; wait for user OK or corrections.
6. **Author**. Run [`author-spec`](../author-spec/SKILL.md) for each target with the confirmed answers. For `specs/definition/quality.md`, that write is [`author-quality-rubrics`](../author-quality-rubrics/SKILL.md) step 5, which returns the paths. Save new notes and confirmed PoC request entries; prune consumed or rejected ones.
7. **File PoCs** (optional same run): for each confirmed request, offer [`create-project-task`](../create-project-task/SKILL.md) or [`create-project-epic`](../create-project-epic/SKILL.md) with purpose/scope/outcome in the body, or defer to the planner. Update the log Status/Issue when filed. Dependents may use native blocked-by that issue only.
8. **Open a spec PR** per [Spec PRs](../../../docs/pull-requests.md#spec-prs), covering the specs, notes, and PoC log of this run.
9. **Offer the next target**: when formalizing, the next keep-list spec whose blocking fields are set. Otherwise stop. A new target is a new run of these steps. Optionally note `review-spec` and `audit-spec-tbd` when TBDs remain; do not run them unless the user asks.

## Rules

- One `specs/` path per run, except unset blocking fields, which may share a run. Several runs may follow each other in one session.
- No downstream capture until that slice is being formalized and its blocking fields are set.
- Requirement notes and PoC request log entries are not specs: never cite them as authority or build main code on them unconfirmed. The PoC README is the build authority for that exploration. A filed task is the authority when agent-orc or a wave owns it.
- Follow `author-spec` rules for writing; do not paste authoring rules into this skill or into `specs/`.
- Do not run `review-spec`, `audit-spec-applicability`, `audit-spec-terminology`, or `audit-spec-tbd` unless the user separately asks, or step 1 offers the TBD audit and the user accepts.
