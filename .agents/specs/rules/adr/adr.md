# Authoring rules: architecture

Read this before editing `specs/adr/adr.md` or `specs/adr/archive/README.md`. Do not copy these rules into the spec.

Every other file under `specs/adr/` follows **Rules for every architecture spec** below. Those rules files name this one under **Also read**.

The architecture records the technical decisions the product is built on: stack, frameworks, libraries, data storage, integration methods, and the overall system architecture. Each decision is an architecture decision record (ADR) under `decisions/`, written per [decision.md](decision.md). It is downstream of `specs/vision.md`, `specs/definition/definition.md`, `specs/definition/quality.md`, `specs/product/product.md`, `specs/ux/ux.md`, and `specs/qa/qa.md` (including tools constraints). Read them, and every spec an ADR cites, before writing. Code and data shape that realize Accepted ADRs live in `specs/technical/`; this folder does not replace that design.

## Rules for every architecture spec

- **Realizes the upstream specs**: a decision serves what the vision, definition, quality, product, UX, and QA (Must tools and cited Situational tools) state. It does not change a product rule or an interface behavior on its own.
- **Imposes through the upstream spec**: when a decision limits an upstream spec (a platform, a quality target, an entity count, a screen behavior), list it under the ADR's **Imposes**. Revise the constrained spec first. It states the limit in its own terms and cites the ADR ID. An imposition that is material per [alignment.md](../../alignment.md) needs product-owner approval. Until then the ADR stays Proposed.
- **Accepted is binding**: only an Accepted ADR authorizes code. A Proposed ADR does not.
- **Immutable once accepted**: do not rewrite an Accepted ADR. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes it, then archive the old one per **Archive** below. Fixing a typo or a broken link is allowed.
- **Archived is out of context**: do not read `archive/` unless explicitly asked. No file outside `archive/` cites an archived ADR, except the **Supersedes** line of its successor.
- **Named technology**: this is the only spec layer that names frameworks, libraries, products, services, protocols, and data formats, except the stack choice in `specs/definition/definition.md`. State versions when the decision depends on them.
- **Stack set by the definition**: the Stack ADR realizes the stack the definition names, per [decision.md](decision.md). An ADR does not choose a different stack. Changing stack means revising the definition first.
- **Decisions, not implementation**: state what is chosen, the boundaries it sets, and why. No code, step-by-step setup, or tuning values.
- **Traceable**: every ADR states which upstream items inform it. `traceability.md` maps them.
- **Concise**: each Markdown file stays under 500 words. Split by logical unit and link. The type's own rules file says where to move the extra part.

## Overview

One paragraph: the overall shape of the running system (its main parts and how they connect), citing the ADRs that set it. No decision is made here.

## Stack

One row per area: Stack, Frameworks, Libraries, Data storage, Integrations, System architecture. Each row gives the current choice in a few words and links the Accepted ADRs that make it. Write "N/A — reason" with "—" for ADR when an area does not apply, grounded in the definition or the product profile. Add a row when one area has more than one decision. Every Accepted ADR appears in the row matching its **Category**. Proposed ADRs do not appear here.

## Index

Keep the global-spec list. For a decision, copy `decisions/_template.md` to `decisions/<NNNN>-<kebab-name>.md`, fill the copy, and add it under Decisions as `[ADR-NNNN: Title](decisions/<file>.md) — Status`. List Proposed and Accepted ADRs only. Leave `_template.md` unchanged. When there is no decision yet, write "None yet".

If the index pushes `adr.md` past 500 words, move it to `specs/adr/index.md` and leave a link.

## Archive

`archive/` holds superseded and deprecated ADRs. Its `README.md` states what the folder holds and that agents do not read it unless explicitly asked. It does not list the ADRs.

- **Superseded**: the new ADR names the old one under **Supersedes**. In the old ADR, set Status to Superseded, set Date, and add `- **Superseded by**: ADR-NNNN` under Status.
- **Deprecated** (no successor): set Status to Deprecated, set Date, and add `- **Deprecated because**: reason` under Status.
- Then move the file, and any split files, to `archive/` under the same name. Remove it from the index and the Stack, and update `traceability.md`. Every spec that cites it cites the successor instead, or drops the constraint.
- A Proposed ADR that is declined is deleted. Its number is not reused.
